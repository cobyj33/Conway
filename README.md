A Sandbox built around Conway's game of life, which is built around a grid of "alive" and "dead" cells, and is based upon two rules:

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.

Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

With just these two rules, many interesting animations can be created through the change in generations of each frame
